# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns, marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and event handling for an interactive gaming experience.
